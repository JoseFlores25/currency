      <p>
        My name is Jose Flores and I'm working on becoming a project about
        crypto
        <br /> I decide to build a Currency Exchange project by using React.
        <br /> I was able to use props, useEffect, useState, and components to
        build my Currency project.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
