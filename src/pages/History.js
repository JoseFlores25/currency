        The history of cryptocurrencies can be traced back to the 1980s, when
        <br />
        they were called cyber currencies. These coins started gaining in <br />
        popularity in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, which was created
        <br />
        by an anonymous programmer or group of programmers under the name
        <br />
        Satoshi Nakamoto.
